    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Lyric : </h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        … You've got a friend in me <br>
You've got a friend in me <br>
When the road looks rough ahead <br>
And you're miles and miles <br>
From your nice warm bed <br>
You just remember what your old pal said <br>
Boy, you've got a friend in me <br>
Yeah, you've got a friend in me <br><br>
… You've got a friend in me <br>
You've got a friend in me <br>
If you've got troubles, I've got 'em too <br>
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you <br>
We stick together and can see it through <br>
Cause you've got a friend in me <br>
You've got a friend in me <br><br>
… Some other folks might be <br>
A little bit smarter than I am <br>
Bigger and stronger too <br>
Maybe <br>
But none of them will ever love you <br>
The way I do, it's me and you <br> <br>
… Boy, and as the years go by <br>
Our friendship will never die <br>
You're gonna see it's our destiny <br>
You've got a friend in me <br>
You've got a friend in me <br>
You've got a friend in me <br>
    </p>
